- Just had a thought on possibly creating struct types for each sink that would have a variable of LogFileInfo so that 
  I could possibly make the LogFileInfo struct smaller in size but more useful in ease of setup.
- Could Also Possibly create namespace functions similar to InitializeSinks(), CreateSinks, InitializeLoggers()
  in where these functions would be the default setup for each sink above and then in the Logger class, actually
  go ahead and implement the targeted changes if a user would like to override the default settings that way.

- TODO: See about getting rid of the check as well as the return for m_fileName in GetFileName() and just 
  return m_filePath.filename()
- TODO: Implement a much better filter for extension and file name assignment in RenameLogFile()
- TODO: Possibly just extract RenameLogFile() functionality to RenameFile()?
